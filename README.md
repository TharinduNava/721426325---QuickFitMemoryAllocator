# 721426325---QuickFitMemoryAllocator
This project simulates a basic memory allocator using the QuickFit algorithm, which allocates and frees memory blocks based on predefined lists (small, medium, large). It provides a simple example of how memory can be managed dynamically by allocating from and deallocating back to various block sizes.
